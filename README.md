A pipeline building library based on *arrows*. Arrows are abstractions of computation, and were proposed by [John Hughes](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/) [Generalising Monads to Arrows, in Science of Computer Programming 37, pp67-111, May 2000]. Like monads, arrows provide a general structure to libraries, but are more general; arrows allow multiple inputs and behaviour that is independed of input.
