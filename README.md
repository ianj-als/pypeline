A pipeline building library based on *arrows*. Arrows are abstractions of computation, and were proposed by [John Hughes](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/) [Generalising Monads to Arrows, in Science of Computer Programming 37, pp67-111, May 2000]. Like monads, arrows provide a general structure for libraries, but are more general; arrows allow multiple inputs and behaviour that is independed of input.

This implementation is heavily inspired by the Haskell arrow typeclasses: a description of which can be found [here](http://www.haskell.org/arrows/index.html).
